# NBA-Defense-Analysis

Suvrath Penmetcha, Ryan Chan and I are using NBA player tracking data to understand more about defense in basketball.

Eventually, we hope to get a truly analytical answer to ranking defensive quality of NBA players.

We are using code from Raj Shah at his player tracking repository: https://github.com/rajshah4/NBA_SportVu.
